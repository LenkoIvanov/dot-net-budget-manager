The React&.NET budgeting tool is a project that I am doing for an university course.

The idea is fairly simple and popular - it's a tool that tracks how much you spent. I chose this idea, because as I started
getting into frontend development I wrote some half-baked budgeting tools to teach myself the basics of React. Now, for the
frontend part at least, I wish to implement most of the things that I've learned. The project will have routing with two
simple routes and will implement some basic CRUD functionalities.

The hard part, which prompted me to choose a relatively simple idea like the budget app, is the .NET backend part of the
project. This is my first time writing a .NET API and is a learning experience for me. Can't say that I am not excited
for the challenge.

This will also be my first time writing any sort of documentation - I will detail the technologies used and the functionalities
of the app.
